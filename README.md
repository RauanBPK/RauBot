Hi, my name is RauBot, a very dumb (discord) bot... for now.<br>
### Why?
I was bored and decided to code a Discord bot for the server we play (mostly) Valorant.
I am learning while doing, so there are some stuff that makes it not so scalable now.
The main thing is that because I use it on one (well, two) Discord guilds only, the states are not being properly separated.
Whether I'll fix this or not depends if I want to use it on more guilds, but I am not sure.
### Commands
```
       RAUBOT Commands
/dadjoke... -> Silly joke
/oi........ -> Say hi to RauBot!
/mapa...... -> Draw a random map to be played
/boneco.... -> Draw a agent
/role...... -> Draw a role
/toprajogo. -> Adds your name to the list to play (you can add your friends as well, remove members, set a time you intend to play and reset the whole thing)
/5v5....... -> Adds your name to the 5x5 list - Draws 2 teams (same options as "/toprajogo")
/moveteam.. -> Moves a team to another voice channel (good if you have 10 friends on your Discord server willing to play with you) (wow, so popular)
/comp...... -> Suggest a agent comp (looks for the most used ones on a desired map or draws a random one)
```

### Language
I mixed english and portuguese, oops.

### Good practices
Mostly there, but could be improved
